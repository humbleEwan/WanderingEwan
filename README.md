# Wandering Ewan

## Note
Only compiles on older versions of `npm` (v16 or later)

## Summary
This project is a simple 2D game that runs in the browser. You can go around 100x100 grid sized randomly generated cave system while fighting skeletons.

## Features
* Random generation using a cellular automaton
* Different battle screen in combat
* A 'render egnine' which I have used to make the project easier to complete.
